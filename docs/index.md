# Full Feature List

### Full Feature List of pDataService

1. **Data Store Configuration**:
  * Customizable DataStore key (`DataStoreKey`).
  * Versioning support (`DataVersion`).
  * Configurable intervals for auto-saving and profile backups.
2. **Auto-Save Functionality**:
  * Automatically saves player profiles at regular intervals.
3. **Profile Management**:
  * Active management of player profiles, including loading and saving.
  * Supports default data values for new profiles.
4. **Profile Backup and Restore**:
  * Automatic backups of player profiles.
  * Ability to restore profiles from backups using a designated backup key suffix.
5. **Data Compression**:
  * Option to enable or disable data compression for storage efficiency.
6. **Rate Limiting**:
  * Implements rate limiting on save requests to prevent spamming.
7. **Profile Locking Mechanism**:
  * Locks profiles during modifications to prevent concurrent changes.
8. **Event Hooks**:
  * Custom event hooks for various profile actions (load, save, delete).
  * Allows for custom callbacks on these events.
9. **Data Validation**:
  * Ensures that all player data meets required specifications before saving or loading.
  * Checks for required fields and their data types.
10. **Logging System**:
  * Comprehensive logging with different levels (INFO, ERROR, WARNING).
  * Tracks important events and errors for debugging.
11. **Async Data Operations**:
  * Non-blocking data saving with coroutines, enhancing performance during player interactions.
12. **Retry Mechanism**:
  * Retries failed save and load operations up to a specified maximum number of attempts.
13. **Global Data Handling**:
  * Ability to save and load global data separate from player profiles.
14. **Profile Expiration**:
  * Supports profile expiration with configurable expiration times.
15. **Statistics Tracking**:
  * Maintains statistics for each playerâ€™s profile save operations.
16. **Snapshot Management**:
  * Ability to manage snapshots of player profiles for historical tracking.
17. **Profile Clearing**:
  * Functionality to clear all active profiles from memory.
18. **Customizable Error Handling**:
  * Defined error messages for different failure scenarios during data operations.
19. **Initialization Method**:
  * Initializes the service and starts the auto-save coroutine upon setup.
20. **Profile Data Updates**:
  * Allows for updating existing player profile data efficiently.
21. **Last Save Time Tracking**:
  * Tracks the last time a profile was saved for each player.

# Configuration Tips

!!! note
     Make sure that you configurate the **WHOLE** config file because everything is managed from there.

**Quick glance at Config module script:**

```lua
local Config = {}

-- Data store settings
Config.DataStoreKey = "CHANGE_ME" 
assert(Config.DataStoreKey ~= "CHANGE_ME", "DataStoreKey must be set!")

Config.DataVersion = "1.0.1"

-- Auto-saving settings
Config.AutoSaveInterval = 60 -- Time in seconds between automatic saves
Config.ProfileBackupInterval = 300 -- Time in seconds between backups

-- Request settings
Config.RequestRateLimit = 5 -- Minimum time in seconds between requests for the same player

-- Encryption settings
Config.EnableEncryption = true -- Enable or disable encryption
Config.EncryptionKey = 123 -- Key used for encryption/decryption (should be a number)
assert(type(Config.EncryptionKey) == "number", "EncryptionKey must be a number!")

-- Logging settings
Config.EnableLogging = true -- Enable or disable logging
Config.LogLevel = "INFO" -- Log level: INFO, WARNING, ERROR

-- Profile management settings
Config.MaxInactiveDuration = 3600 -- Maximum duration in seconds to keep inactive profiles in memory
Config.CleanupInterval = 600 -- Time in seconds between profile cleanup checks
Config.MaxBackupsPerPlayer = 5 -- Maximum number of backups to keep per player

Config.MaxRetries = 3 -- Maximum number of retries for saving/loading profiles
Config.UseBackup = true -- Whether to use backups for profiles
Config.BackupKeySuffix = "_backup" -- Suffix for backup keys
Config.CompressionEnabled = true -- Enable or disable data compression
Config.ProfileExpirationTime = 3600 -- Duration in seconds before profiles expire

return Config
```
